### Plan for C++23 Ranges

[Link to paper](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2214r0.html)

Presenter: Conor

CH: Basically just summarized the Tier-1 choices ... slight difference in `group_by` 

EN: I am ok with that :+1:

### `ranges::to`

[Link to paper](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p1206r2.pdf)

Presenter: Corentin

CJ: presenting

CJ: Have to remove leaving off `()` on ranges to

EN: NOOOOOOO!!!!

TB: I missed what the no was for

EN: I spent a lot of work on that - sad to see it go

CJ: Added recursive ranges

EN: I have deployed a lot of uses to ranges::to - one thing i notice ppl just want implicit conversion to work, I was wondering can we get half way there with 
something like `ranges::to<>` and you get a view-like type

CJ: I like the current design, I like specifying. 

CH: I could see the utility - but most cases it because I want a vector or vocabulary type

CB: I second what conor said, might use it if it existing

TB: It is something that rust does, they have a method called `.collect()`

CH: I think Java 8 streams has the same `collect()` method

CJ: Do we want to mandate in the implementation?

TB: if i ever manage to properly manage to write the tagged ctor thing - they can have container that takes a range ctor 

TB: if 3P want to hook in, they have to add one of these tagged ctors

CJ: the real question is how much "fall back" do we want? for it to work for all types of ranges

TB: having a fallback that goes through views::common and then a C++17 iterator pair

...

TB: so there are 4 cases

CJ: not sure about the wording for the last case

...

TB: sounds like you need help with the wording

CJ: don't have wording for everything

CJ: at this point there are about 4-5 implementations of `ranges::to` 

EN: stone soup method is my approach - do it really poorly and hopefully someone will come along and help

### `views::enumerate`

[Link to paper](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2164r0.pdf)

Presenter: Corentin

CJ: `struct result`, should index be `const` or not

TB: typically non-static const members are avoided - that being said not sure why anyone would want to modify it

CH: yea, in my experience `index` is always used as a value not a variable (if you did use it as a variable you probably could have used it as a value)

...

EN: there is something particular about index_view - b/c it is only going to ever represent index starting at 0 - i forget the details - i would have to go 
diffing for it

CJ: this design doesn't use iota so i don't think it should be an issue? does that sound right?

EN: something like that

CJ: might be useful for someone to look at the wording

IL: who is making the wording for ranges?

CJ: mostly Casey

EN: what was the question?

IL: who do most of the wording for range?

EN: Just me and Casey

EN: Casey has unfortunately been very unresponsive, Microsoft is keeping him busy

TB: is this planned to be discussed in LEWG yet?

CJ: it is ready - but i don't think it is slotted yet - just discussed on the reflector

CJ: `zip_with` (aka `zip_transform`) + enumerate is also brought up 

IL: return type of algorithms - how hard is to change the return type of `sort`

TB: in v3 `sort` is an action - i dont think those havent been proposed yet

EN: there haven't been any proposals - they are of middling importance

IL: should this be explored more?

EN: i was never entirely satisfied - it is still a bit researchy

TB: one thing i would love to see - some way for user code to hook into pipe syntax |> 

EN: views are specified in terms of ... some sort of 

TB: range adapter closure object

EN: what things are and are not the above is currently unspecified - you can't actual build functions that recognize these things and compose

EN: in theory you want your pipe operator to hook into "range adapter closure object" but there is no way to currently do that

CJ: if |> is approved, do we still want the | .. 

TB: i think so

CH: Barry's take was that it was still good to add them to avoid confusion
