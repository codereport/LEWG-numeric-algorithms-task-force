### Attendees

* CH - Conor Hoekstra (NVIDIA)
* MD - Michal Dominiak (NVIDIA)
* CB - Chris Di Bella (Google)

### Summary of Discussion

Chris is working on better version of `std::accumulate`
* but didn't have anything to present at this meeting

Then we discussed options for where to include C++23 numeric algorithms:

Note: C++20 `ranges::algorithms` are in the `<algorithm>` header

1) Place in `<numeric>` and then include `<numeric>` in `<algorithm>`
2) Place them both in `<algorithm>` and `<numeric>` separately
    -> hopefully force ppl to just use the new algorithms that will all be available
3) Place in just `<algorithm>`

### Action Items

* Chris to ask Niebler about it offline too maybe
* Chris to send out an email to LEWG getting their take
