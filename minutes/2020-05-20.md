discussion about paper

[ this is where the notes stopped ]]

**Summary of discussion about `fold`:**

- Note that `fold` is intended to be the serial/sequential reduction algorithm
- Mostly focused on how to determine return type of the init-less `fold` (a fold that doesn't take an initial value)
- The two main options are:
   1) Use type of the elements in the range or the type resulting from the projection
   2) Use the type returned from the binary operation provided to the fold
- The advantage of 1 is that you don't require the accumulator parameter for the binary operation to be "default constructible" if you have a user defined type
- The con of 1 is that if you want to specify the type to be different than what the range/projection would give you - you need to specify an initial value (basically means you can-t use the init-less fold)

**Consensus from CB, MD & CH**: Option 1 is more convenient when you think about A) you get more flexibility in specifying the type of the return through use of projection and B) if you really need something different you can just fall back on the overload of fold with an initial value for the accumulator
